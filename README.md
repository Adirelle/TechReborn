# TechReborn

TechReborn is a resurrection of GregTech 2.78 for modern Minecraft. It brings most of GT4's features and behaviors to Minecraft, with lots of tweaks, and a few editions. It also aims to be more compatible with other mods than GregTech, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a standalone mod, compatible with but not dependent on IC2.

TechReborn is currently in a beta state.

We have permission to use Greg's textures, see here :https://i.imgur.com/YQEMrq5.png?1

The current main maintainer is @gigabit101 if you need any help please contact us.

@modmuss50 is a past maintainer of the mod(see http://techreborn.ninja/?p=20).
