# TechReborn

TechReborn is a resurrection of GregTech 2.78 for modern Minecraft. It brings most of GT4's features and behaviors to Minecraft, with lots of tweaks, and a few editions. It also aims to be more compatible with other mods than GregTech, and has the ultimate goal of becoming a standalone mod, compatible with but not dependent on IC2.

TechReborn is currently in a beta state. Crashes or bugs may happen at any time, so *please* do not use this on a world that is important to you, or at the very least back it up on every update.

We have permission to use Greg's textures (see [here](https://i.imgur.com/YQEMrq5.png?1)).

The current main maintainer is [@gigabit101](https://github.com/gigabit101/) if you need any help please contact us (see 'Contact' section below).

[@modmuss50](https://github.com/modmuss50/) is a past maintainer of the mod (see [here](http://techreborn.ninja/?p=20)).
